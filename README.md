# Snake-AI-Game
The objective of the game is to become the longest snake on the board by eating apples, which spawn at random positions each time one is consumed. The snake uses pathfinding algorithms like A* to find the shortest path to the apples while avoiding obstacles and staying alive. In addition to obstacles, there are zombie snakes that target the player's head and three other competing snakes. The top-performing snake is determined by its length and the number of kills it achieves.
